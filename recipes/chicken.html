        <li>2 tablespoons fresh rosemary, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>1 lemon, zested and halved</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F).</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix the minced garlic, chopped rosemary, thyme, parsley, lemon zest, olive oil, melted butter, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Rub the herb mixture all over the chicken, including under the skin and inside the cavity for maximum flavor.</li>
        <li>Stuff the chicken cavity with the halved lemon, onion quarters, and a few sprigs of rosemary and thyme.</li>
        <li>Tie the legs together with kitchen twine and tuck the wings under the body to ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken breast-side up on a rack in a roasting pan.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the juices run clear and the internal temperature reaches 75°C (165°F) in the thickest part.</li>
        <li>Let the chicken rest for 10–15 minutes before carving to allow the juices to redistribute.</li>
        <li>Serve with your favorite side dishes and enjoy!</li>
