        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups milk (whole milk preferred)</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon paprika (optional, for extra flavor)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
        <li>Bread crumbs (optional, for topping if baking)</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>Cook the elbow macaroni according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Whisk in the flour and cook for 1–2 minutes to form a roux (a thick paste), stirring constantly.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour in the milk while whisking to avoid lumps. Cook for 3–5 minutes, until the sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low and stir in the shredded cheddar cheese until melted and smooth.</li>
        <li>Season the cheese sauce with salt, pepper, and paprika (if using).</li>
        <li>Mix the cooked macaroni into the cheese sauce until evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Optional: For a baked version, pour the macaroni and cheese into a greased baking dish, top with Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs, and bake at 180°C (350°F) for 15–20 minutes, or until golden and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Serve warm and enjoy!</li>
     </ol>
