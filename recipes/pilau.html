    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fragrant Swahili Pilau is a beloved East African rice dish infused with warm spices, 
        tender meat, and rich, aromatic flavors. Traditionally cooked in one pot, 
        this savory dish blends ingredients like cumin, cloves, cardamom, 
        and cinnamon with perfectly seasoned beef or chicken and long-grain rice. 
        Often served at celebrations and family gatherings, pilau is a comforting, 
        flavorful meal that brings people together—delicious on its own or paired 
        with kachumbari (fresh tomato-onion salad).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups long-grain rice (e.g., basmati), rinsed</li>
        <li>500g beef, cubed</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons pilau masala (or mix of cumin, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>3–4 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>4 cups water or beef broth</li>
        <li>1–2 potatoes, peeled and cubed (optional, for added texture)</li>
        <li>Fresh coriander or kachumbari (optional, for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add chopped onions and cook until golden brown and caramelized.</li>
        <li>Add minced garlic and ginger, and sauté for 1–2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the beef cubes and cook until browned on all sides.</li>
        <li>Stir in pilau masala, black pepper, and ground coriander. Cook for 2–3 minutes to allow the spices to blend.</li>
        <li>Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they break down and form a thick sauce.</li>
        <li>Add the cubed potatoes (if using) and mix well with the meat and spices.</li>
        <li>Pour in the water or beef broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and let the beef simmer for about 15–20 minutes until tender.</li>
        <li>Add rinsed rice to the pot and stir to combine. Taste and adjust salt if needed.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot and reduce heat to low. Let it cook undisturbed for 15–20 minutes or until the rice is fully cooked and liquid is absorbed.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, fluff the rice gently with a fork. Serve hot, optionally with fresh coriander or kachumbari on the side.</li>
    </ol>
