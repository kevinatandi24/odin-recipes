      <h2>Steps</h2>

          <li>Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>
          <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
          <li>Heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add chopped onion and sauté until translucent.</li>
          <li>Add minced garlic and cook for another minute.</li>
          <li>Add the ground beef and cook until browned. Drain any excess fat.</li>
          <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 15–20 minutes to develop flavor.</li>
          <li>In a separate bowl, mix ricotta cheese with a pinch of salt and pepper (optional: add a beaten egg for richness).</li>
          <li>Lightly grease a baking dish. Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom.</li>
